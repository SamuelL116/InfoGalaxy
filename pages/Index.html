            <p class="image-tex1"><i>"As the pandemic unfolded in spring 2020, many Americans saw their lives swiftly reshaped by stay-at-home orders, school closures and the onset of remote work. 
                From video calls with isolating or sick family members to holiday celebrations by video call amid canceled travel plans, social distancing recommendations altered 
                major life events and elements of daily life alike. 

                Technology bridged physical distance as restrictions continued. Religious services, doctor appointments and essential errands moved online. At the same time, 
                organizations implementing remote work and Americans spending more time online worried about “Zoom fatigue” and tech burnout.
            
                Relationships also evolved during this uprooting of typical routines. Pandemic “pods” helped some Americans maintain connection, 
                but they complicated relationships and family dynamics at the same time. In some cases, friendships relied on technology to stay afloat. 
                And others needed to find new ways to connect amid growing isolation. 

                With this broader societal context in mind, this chapter explores the ways in which Americans’ lives changed in the pandemic – and the ways that technology was a part of several transitions. Results from the April 2021 Pew Research Center survey show that even as a majority of Americans considered the internet essential to them personally during the 
                pandemic and four-in-ten used tech in new ways, some feel worn out or fatigued from video calls and a quarter feel less close to close family members than before the coronavirus outbreak."</i>
