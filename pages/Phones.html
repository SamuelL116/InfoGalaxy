<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>
  As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the latest iPhones were the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. These phones were released on September 14, 2021.
</br>
</br>
  The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini come with a 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR display, respectively. Both phones are powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip and have a dual-camera system with 12-megapixel Ultra-Wide and Wide cameras. They also have improved battery life and come in five colors.
</br>
</br>  
  The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max feature a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display, respectively. They are also powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip and have a triple-camera system with 12-megapixel Ultra-Wide, Wide, and Telephoto cameras. They also have improved battery life and come in four colors.
</br>
</br>
  All four models of the iPhone 13 series have 5G capability, Ceramic Shield front cover for durability, and support for MagSafe charging. They also run on iOS 15, which includes new features such as FaceTime enhancements, improved Maps, and new privacy features.</br>

</p>
<h2 style="float:right">Google Pixel</h2>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<p>
  Google Pixel phones are a series of smartphones designed and developed by Google. They run on the Android operating system and are known for their excellent camera quality, fast performance, and clean software experience. Here's some information about the latest Google Pixel phones as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021:</br>
</br>
  The Pixel 5a features a 6.34-inch OLED display, 5G connectivity, and a dual-camera system with a 12.2-megapixel primary camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera. It also has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, a headphone jack, and a 4680mAh battery.
</br>
  The Pixel 5 features a 6.0-inch OLED display, 5G connectivity, and a dual-camera system with a 12.2-megapixel primary camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera. It also has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, a Snapdragon 765G processor, and a 4080mAh battery.

</p>
<h2>Huawei</h2>
<p>
  Huawei is a Chinese multinational technology company that produces smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices. Huawei is known for producing high-quality smartphones with advanced features, such as fast processors, high-resolution cameras, and long-lasting batteries.
</br>
</br>
  Some of Huawei's latest phone models include the Huawei Mate 40 Pro, Huawei P40 Pro, and Huawei Nova 7i. These phones come with advanced features like 5G connectivity, high-resolution cameras with AI-powered photography features, and large OLED screens.
</br>
</br>
  However, it's important to note that Huawei's phones may not have access to Google services due to the company being added to the U.S. Entity List in 2019, which restricts Huawei's access to U.S. technology and services. This means that newer Huawei phones may not come with Google apps like Gmail, Google Maps, or YouTube, and may use Huawei's own app store instead of Google Play.
</br>
</br>
Overall, Huawei phones offer advanced features and high-quality hardware, but their lack of access to Google services may be a consideration for some users.
